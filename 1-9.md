# AI Notes: 1-9-2017

(HW: on BB, optionally read these)
(HW: Read ch. 1, 26!)

Ch1: What is AI? Why is it worthy of study?
Ch26: What does it mean to think? Could/should artifacts do so?

We had some examples of AI- two sides:  
..* Calmer AI like Data, C-3P0, R2-D2, Jarvis, etc.  
..* Aggressive AI like Terminator, Agent Smith, Cylons, Wheatley, HAL-9000  
..* And some in the middle, like Chappie
